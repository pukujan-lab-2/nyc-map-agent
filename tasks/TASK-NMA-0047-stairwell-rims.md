## Goal

Give each stairwell cut in a ceiling or floor a clean, closed edge, with no shards and no view of the floor above

## Why

Climbing a stair, the ceiling broke into jagged pieces and the floor above showed through (recording of a 4 train trip to Fulton St, 2026-11-11)

## Allowed files

- `src/lib/map/stationWalk.ts` (where ceilings and floors are cut round a stair, and the rim along it)
- `src/lib/map/three/stationScene.ts` (drawing the rim, closing the wedges at a stair's bends)
- `src/lib/map/stationWalk.test.ts`
- this task record and `checkpoints/CURRENT.md`

## Human outcome

Climbing out of Fulton St in the trip preview, the ceiling overhead and the floor above meet each stair in a clean edge, so the demo recording no longer shows the ceiling breaking into pieces.

## Scope and boundaries

- In scope: the edge where a stairwell is cut in a room's ceiling or in the floor above, and the gaps on the outside of a stair's bends.
- Out of scope: stair widths (widening them broke the 14 St-Union Sq route in the browser test), how people walk through a station, the stepped tops of stair side walls where a parapet meets a full wall.
- Dependencies/uncertainty: checked with fixed camera views in a local build, not by replaying the recorded trip.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Looking up from a room beside a stair, the ceiling meets the stair's side walls in a straight line.
- [x] Climbing, no piece of the room's ceiling or of the upper floor hangs inside the stair's walls under its own ceiling.
- [x] Nothing opens on the outside of a stair's bends.
- [x] Steps stay 2 m wide; walking is unchanged.
- [x] A unit test at Fulton St and 14 St-Union Sq fails if a slab cell reaches inside a stair's walls where the stairwell opens it.

## Evidence and sources

- Fixed camera views of Fulton St (station `418`) rendered on the MacBook Pro from a local build, before and after: 26 views of four stairs (foot, middle, climbing, from below on each side, from above) and two climbing views on each of 20 inner stairs.
- A raycast through the remaining shard over one climb hit the upper floor at -5 m, 0.5 m from the stair's line; after the change the same ray hits the head wall.
- `pnpm test`: 1,819 passed, 8 skipped. `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` pass.
