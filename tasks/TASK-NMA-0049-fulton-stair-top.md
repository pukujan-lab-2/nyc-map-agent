## Goal

The trip to the E exit on Fulton Street climbs out of the hall facing up the stair and steps off at the top without passing a wall

## Why

The live recording after #114 still showed the camera in a wall near the top of the stair out of the hall

## Human outcome

Watching the trip to the E exit on Fulton Street, the climb out of the hall faces up the stair until the top, then turns onto the floor beside it with nothing in the way.

## Scope and boundaries

- In scope: how far ahead the trip preview's eye looks inside a station; a stair's side walls over its last half metre of rise where a floor runs beside them.
- Out of scope: routes (they still step off a stair's side near its top), stair widths, the station data, and the camera on streets and rides.
- Dependencies/uncertainty: Fulton St's hall height is approximate (#97).

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Replaying the trip preview's camera to the E exit on Fulton Street, no frame is filled by a stair's side wall at arm's length
- [x] Where the way steps off a stair's side near its top, no parapet stands across it
- [x] Steps stay 2 m wide, routes and the camera outside stations are unchanged; unit tests, typecheck and lint pass

## Evidence and sources

- The live recording after #114: about 60 s in, a tiled wall fills the screen near the top of the stair out of the hall.
- The player's camera replayed in a local build on the MacBook Pro matches it: the eye's heading looked 4 m ahead and reached 184 degrees on a stair running at 225, 2.5 m before the top. Looking 1.5 m ahead, it stays on the stair's line until 1 m before the top, and no frame is filled by a wall.
- The route steps off the stair 0.7 to 1 m before its top, 1.5 m off its middle line, through the parapet; with that stretch open the replay shows no wall across the way.
- 26 fixed views of Fulton St stairs: the only change is each parapet beside a stair ending about a metre short of the top.
- Unit tests passed (1,819); typecheck and lint clean.

## Reproduction details (only when needed)

Starting revision 5c0934e. Ask the live app "take the 4 train from Grand Central to Fulton Street leaving at 9am tomorrow", play the preview, and watch the step "Use the E exit on Fulton Street" up the stair out of the hall.
