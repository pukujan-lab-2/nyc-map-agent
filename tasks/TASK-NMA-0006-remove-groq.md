- Status: completed
- Owner: claude-code
- Priority: P2
- Depends on: none

## Goal

Voice recordings go only to a speech server the owner names, never to Groq by default.

## Why

The speech-to-text endpoint defaulted to Groq, which the owner did not choose (#634).

## Allowed files

- `server/features/agent/stt.ts`, `stt.test.ts`, `.env.example`, `deploy/.env.example`, `docs/PLAN-copilot-port.md`, `checkpoints/`, this file.

## Human outcome

Voice recordings only go to a server the owner chose.

## Scope and boundaries

- In scope: the Groq default and wording.
- Out of scope: running a replacement Whisper server, the front end, docs/PRIVACY.md.
- Dependencies/uncertainty: none.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A search for groq in shipped files finds nothing.
- [ ] /api/stt answers 503 without STT_BASE_URL.

## Evidence and sources

Added by #401 (2026-10-24). `npx vitest run server/features/agent/stt.test.ts src/lib/voice` passes (29 tests); `tsc` and `eslint` are clean; the grep for groq is empty.

## Reproduction details (only when needed)
