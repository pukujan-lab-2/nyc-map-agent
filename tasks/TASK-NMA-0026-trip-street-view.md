- Status: active
- Owner: claude-code
- Priority: medium
- Depends on: none

## Goal

Trip preview walks at street level and goes down the station's real stairs

## Why

The preview showed walks from above and slid the marker through walls into the station

## Allowed files

- `src/features/agent/` (usePlayer, flythrough, stationStairs, tripCamera and their tests), `src/lib/transit/stationXray.ts`, `src/features/transit/xray.ts` (re-export only), `tasks/`, `checkpoints/CURRENT.md`

## Human outcome

Pressing Play on a subway trip shows the walk to the station from the rider's eyes, goes down the station's real stairs with the station drawn in x-ray, rides overhead, then climbs out and walks to the door at eye level.

## Scope and boundaries

- In scope: the trip preview's camera on foot and its path through stations.
- Out of scope: the x-ray data and its hand-made station layouts (another pull request), the real street view mode, a view picked from Change view (still wins).
- Dependencies/uncertainty: 77 of 273 stations with x-ray data connect an entrance to a platform today; the rest fall back.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] on the default Map view, every street walk in the trip preview is seen from a 1.7 m eye facing along the route
- [x] boarding eases back to the overhead camera and getting off eases into the eye again
- [x] where the station's x-ray ways connect, the walk in goes down the mapped steps to the platform by the train and the walk out climbs to the exit; elsewhere the plain overhead switch stays
- [x] unit tests cover the path picking, the eye rig and the stair timing

Completed:
- The trip preview walked overhead and slid through walls into the station; it now walks at eye level, goes down the mapped stairs with x-ray, and eases to and from the overhead camera at board and alight

Evidence:
- unit tests (stationStairs.test.ts, tripCamera.test.ts) pass; a headless run of the e2e trip fixture showed an 85 degree eye on the walks, the Union Sq stairs in x-ray, an overhead ride and a plain switch at Grand Central

Decisions:
- no new decisions

Changed:
- src/features/agent (usePlayer, flythrough, stationStairs, tripCamera), src/lib/transit/stationXray.ts, .size-limit.json

Blocked/uncertain:
- none

Next:
- merge the pull request, then watch a trip preview on a phone
