## Goal

Subway trains on the map stop for about 30 seconds to a minute, not until the next vehicle report.

## Why

The vehicle report pinned trains in stations with no time limit, so 34% were drawn parked (#643).

## Allowed files

- `src/features/transit/model.ts`, `TransitLayer.tsx`, `maxHold.test.ts`, `e2e/responsive.spec.ts`, `checkpoints/`, this file.

## Human outcome

Trains on the map move like real trains.

## Scope and boundaries

- In scope: the pin rule in estimateTrain.
- Out of scope: default dwell lengths, buses, the held-train detector.
- Dependencies/uncertainty: one live-feed sample was measured.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] 60 s cap with a trouble exception.
- [ ] Tests pass.
- [ ] Parked share re-measured after deploy.

## Evidence and sources

Live feed sample of 480 trips on 2026-11-01: 12% parked by the timetable model, 22% more pinned by the vehicle report, 34% in all. `npx vitest run src/features/transit`: 142 passed; tsc and eslint clean.
