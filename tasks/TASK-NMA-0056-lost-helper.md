## Goal

One where-am-I helper for riders lost in a station, in place of Find exit, Exit help and I'm lost

## Why

The three buttons confuse people and ignore what the app last knew

## Allowed files

- `src/features/underground/` (LostHelper, lostGuess, lostText), `src/lib/underground/lostHelper.ts`
- the three buttons: `src/features/agent/AgentOverlay.tsx`, `src/features/transit/TransitCard.tsx`, `src/features/liveview/RouteGuide.tsx`
- `src/features/agent/schema.ts`, `server/features/agent/prompt.ts`, `src/lib/geo/sharedLocation.ts`, `src/features/agent/stationWalks.ts`
- `e2e/responsive.spec.ts`, `e2e/task-screens.spec.ts`

## Human outcome

A rider lost in a station with no signal sees, in their language, where the app thinks they are (station, train, part of the train, exit) and can text about it.

## Scope and boundaries

- In scope: the helper, its guess and signal line, the text chat through the chat bar, and the three buttons.
- Out of scope: the sign camera (#88), voice-first conversation.
- Dependencies/uncertainty: `navigator.connection` exists only in Chromium; on an iPhone the signal line rests on the position fix.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] One helper behind Find exit, a train card's Find exit and a walk's Where am I.
- [x] Its first message is the guess in the app's language.
- [x] Poor network or position shows one signal line.
- [x] Offline questions get a local answer and go once back online.
- [x] Layout bar passes at all four sizes (e2e/responsive.spec.ts).
- [ ] Checked on the live site.

Completed:
- Find exit, a train card's Exit help and a walk's I'm lost now open one where-am-I helper that states its guess in the app's language and chats by text

Evidence:
- 13 new unit tests for the guess, signal and wording pass; the helper's layout e2e case passes at 320x568, 375x667, 390x844 and 1280x800; the walk case asks the agent exactly once with stage lost

Decisions:
- no new decisions

Changed:
- src/features/underground/LostHelper.tsx, lostGuess.ts, lostText.ts; src/lib/underground/lostHelper.ts; AgentOverlay, TransitCard, RouteGuide; agent schema and prompt

Blocked/uncertain:
- none

Next:
- Let the pull request for #131 merge, then open Find exit on the live site after a trip to Fulton St, offline and in Spanish
