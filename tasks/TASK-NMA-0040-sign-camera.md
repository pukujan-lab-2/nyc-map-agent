- Owner: unassigned
- Priority: P2
- Depends on: none (pull request #87, which names the corner on Exit signs, has merged)

## Goal

Tell a rider where they are in a station and which way they face from a sign the camera reads

## Why

GPS is weak below the street and slow to settle at the top of the exit stairs

## Allowed files

- `src/lib/map/signMatch.ts` and its test
- `src/features/signcam/`
- `e2e/sign-camera.spec.ts`
- `src/lib/flags/registry.ts`, `src/features/index.ts`, `vite.config.ts`, `.size-limit.json`, `package.json`

## Human outcome

Someone standing in a station points their phone at a sign and the app says where that is and which way the exit lies, without waiting for GPS.

## Scope and boundaries

- In scope: the matching function, a minimal screen behind the `signCamera` flag, a feasibility check of what a phone browser can do.
- Out of scope: a button for it in the normal app, saving the text reader for use without signal, step counting, anything that sends camera frames to a server.
- Dependencies/uncertainty: nothing was tried on a phone, and no photo of a real sign was read. Issue #88 has the measurements and the limits.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `matchSign` finds the right sign from partial and misread words, with unit tests that include text the reader really produced.
- [x] The sign camera opens with `?flags=+signCamera`, in the app's eight languages, and passes the layout bar at 320, 375, 390 and 1280 wide.
- [x] Issue #88 says what a phone browser offers and what was only tested on a desktop.
- [ ] Tried on an iPhone and an Android phone in a station.

## Evidence and sources

- `pnpm exec vitest run src/lib/map/signMatch.test.ts`: the matching, including eight misreads from the feasibility run.
- `pnpm exec playwright test e2e/sign-camera.spec.ts`: the screen at four sizes, and in Spanish.
- Issue #88: how many rendered signs the reader got right, by condition, and how few of the app's signs are worded differently from each other.

## Related records

- Owning issue #88; parent #7; depends on #86 and pull request #87 for corner names on Exit signs.
