## Goal

Plan trips with OTP and walks with Valhalla on the VPS

## Why

Owner chose OTP for step-free and LIRR trips, and a self-hosted walking router

## Allowed files

- define bounded paths before implementation.

## Human outcome

Describe what becomes easier, safer, clearer, or possible when this task is complete.

## Scope and boundaries

- Out of scope:
- Dependencies/uncertainty:

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] state observable, task-specific outcomes.

## Evidence and sources

Link repository state at a revision and cite external factual claims directly. Record commands and results for claims that need verification.

## Reproduction details (only when needed)

Completed:
- Trips on the VPS were planned by MOTIS and walks by a public OSRM server; OTP graph and Valhalla tiles are now built on the VPS, and the compose file and app switch to them, with MOTIS kept until 2026-11-08 as a fallback

Evidence:
- 440 server tests pass; 14-trip comparison on trial containers: OTP had fewer changes in 7 trips and equal in 5, arrived earlier in 4 and 3 to 9 minutes later in 7; docker compose config accepted on the VPS

Decisions:
- no new decisions

Changed:
- deploy/docker-compose.vps.yml, deploy/otp/build-graph.sh, deploy/valhalla/build.sh, server/features/agent/valhalla.ts, services.ts, polyline.ts, deploy/README.md

Blocked/uncertain:
- none

Next:
- After merge, check nyc-map-otp and nyc-map-valhalla are up and the live chat's trips and walks come from them; then step-free trips (OTP wheelchair plus Valhalla wheelchair profile) and a bigger OSM extract for Long Island
