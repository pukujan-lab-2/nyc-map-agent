## Current projection

*Updated 2026-11-03, 21:30 UTC. Read this first; it says where the work stands so a new agent does not have to rebuild that from branches and pull requests.*

## Completed recently

- **A phone showed no way to choose the language (#54).** The rail's language chip sat in the wider-screens column and showed nowhere, and the Settings chip is past the right edge of the task row. The chip now sits under Layers on a phone and opens the phone's own picker; the same stored language drives the app's text, the agent's reply language and the voice. Not done: asking once on first launch when the phone's language is not one of the eight, which waits for the owner's call under `docs/DESIGN_RULES.md`.

## In flight

**Street view stopped at the pavement: you could not walk into a station (#62, branch `feat/62-walk-stations`).** Each station now gets a walkable model on first approach (`src/lib/map/stationWalk.ts`), built from the x-ray data and a new `public/transit/elevated.json` (`pnpm build:elevated`, from OpenStreetMap). Walking onto a street stair takes you down to the platforms, drawn on their own canvas because MapLibre won't put the camera under the ground; at an elevated station the stairs take you up and the map camera rises to the platform, 10 m over the city. Walls and platform edges hold you in. Not done: 13 of 274 underground and 7 of 155 elevated stations still have a platform you cannot reach, OpenStreetMap maps street stairs at only 21 elevated stations (the rest get one added at the entrance), and nobody has walked it on a phone.

**A phone shows one bottom sheet at a time (#53, branch `fix/53-one-phone-sheet`).** Opening a station and tapping one of its line chips used to stack the line sheet on the station sheet, each with its own handle. Now every phone sheet built on `PullSheet` joins one stack (`src/lib/store/pullSheet.ts`): only the newest draws, a Back arrow returns to the one under it, and Close line empties the sheet. The station sheet moved off the old vaul drawer onto `PullSheet`, so it sits above the chat bar. Not done: nobody has dragged it on a real phone yet.

**The model switch and the spoken answers merged on 2026-11-02 and 2026-11-03 (#35, pull request #36; #37, pull request #38).** Settings has a Model choice (Auto, Smart or Dev), stored on the phone and sent with each question. Smart tries DeepSeek on InferHub, Qwen, WorkBuddy and a free OpenRouter model through the Octo vault relay, and a watcher probes each one every five minutes with a real tool call and puts failing ones last; Dev is the LFM3 path. The four `SMART_*_KEY` working keys are in the VPS env (`~/apps/nyc-map-agent.env`), so Auto means Smart in production once that build deploys; the watcher renews them daily. Answers and speech now spell out station shorthand ("Times Square-42 Street"), and `POST /api/tts` reads English, Spanish, French and Chinese answers with Kokoro from the copilot speech server on the MacBook Pro; other languages and any failure use the browser voice. Not done: if all four smart providers fail the rider gets the error (Dev is not a last step), a cold Kokoro can leave up to 20 s of silence before the browser voice speaks, the trip suite (`docs/eval/trips/`, 41.2% on LFM3, #23) has not been run on both profiles, and nobody has listened to the voice on a phone.

**Fulton St showed broken slices in x-ray, and nothing at all for the A/C, because OSM had filed the A/C platform under the 2/3 station (#56).** A hand-made layout in `scripts/xray-overrides/fulton.json` now goes under all four station ids (229, 418, A38, M22), with the 2/3 platform moved down a level and a level-2 passage beside the A/C, drawn from reference 3D models the owner has permission to use (never name their creator anywhere). `scripts/xray-overrides.ts` applies the layouts after `pnpm build:xray` and fails if a platform can't be reached from the street. Next: Times Sq-42 St, Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr and Union Sq the same way.

## Next

- **After #62 merges, walk into Fulton St and an elevated station on a phone.** Check that the stairs feel right with the on-screen pad, and that the view below the street keeps up on a mid-range phone.
- **After #53 merges, try station, line chip, Back and Close on a phone.** Check the drag between peek, half and full on the station sheet too, since it no longer uses vaul.
- **After #44 deploys, check sleep and wake on the VPS.** Both containers should show `Exited (0)` 10 minutes after the last request, the first trip after that should come from OTP rather than the built-in router, and OTP's real cold start should be written into `deploy/README.md` and server-management's `vps/services.toml`.
