/**
 * Step-free walks we filmed ourselves, one checkpoint per sign or landmark, in
 * the direction we walked them (2026-11-13): into Cortlandt St by the street
 * elevator on Broadway, the R or W uptown, and out of 14 St-Union Sq across
 * from the Climate Clock. A station here has no model in the app, so this list
 * is what a rider is matched against: the sign they see, the level it is on,
 * and how far the next one is.
 *
 * What is measured and what is a guess: the order, the signs' words and the
 * step counts come from the recording (camera plus the phone's step counter);
 * the levels come from the barometer. The places on the map are estimates,
 * fitted to the street corners the signs name. Nothing here is to scale.
